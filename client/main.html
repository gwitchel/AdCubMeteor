      <p> We are adCub. A business intended to help school districts gain money and businesses gain customers through the previous untouched market of schools. School districts as you know are entirely under-funded, with problems everywhere as a result. The lack of funding is sad, an issue that should be fixed by now. AdCub fully intends to fix this problem. The children of the world deserve funding. Businesses will provide schools with the needed funding in exchange for their chosen advertisements being placed in used areas.</p>

      <p> Our group is composed of six dedicated high school students in a competition throughout all of Colorado among professionals, and adults veyr experienced in coding. The challenge is to use public data to build a business to better help a community, and we landed on the idea of adCub. Our group is the first ever high school team in the competition (we won in our town of Durango) to be competing. Join us on our journey to success of this competition, and help our goals come to reality. </p>

<template name = "howItWorks">
  <p> Adcub is a platform for product discovery. One of the largest untapped demographics for advertising is highschoolers. Adcub solves that problem by allowing companies to mass place ads directly in highschools across america. We currently have {{userSchools}} registered schools, and {{userAds}} currently pending ad request</p>
  <h1> the flow </h1> 
  <ol> 
    <li> An advertiser uses our ad selecting platform to place an ad request</li> 
    <li> that ad request is then sent to all registered school that fit the demographic </li> 
    <li> All registered schools have an account they can log into in order to view ad requests </li> 
    <li> If a school aggess to accept and ad request their given charge is withdrawn from the advertisers account and suspended until the placement is verified </li>
    <li> Once the school has placed the ad a verification picture is sent to the advertiser, and upon verificatio that the ad was actually place the fund are then transsfered to the schools account </li>
