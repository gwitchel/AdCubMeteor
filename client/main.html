AdCub fully intends to fix this problem. The children of the world deserve funding. Businesses will provide schools with the needed funding in exchange for their chosen advertisements being placed in used areas.</p>

      <p> Our group is composed of six dedicated high school students in a competition throughout all of Colorado among professionals, and adults veyr experienced in coding. The challenge is to use public data to build a business to better help a community, and we landed on the idea of adCub. Our group is the first ever high school team in the competition (we won in our town of Durango) to be competing. Join us on our journey to success of this competition, and help our goals come to reality. </p>
